# x-men-top-trumps

My first game!

I plan to make a top trumps game where you are given a starting hand of cards and must win cards from the computer until their hand is empty.

Course Requirements
• You need to have it as a public repository on GitHub - DONE
o In the repo you will also need a README.md with a short intro to the project. - DONE
• You must have at least 15 Git commits for the project and repo on GitHub - DONE
• Your JS code must be formatted as functions or Classes! - DONE
• You must use click or keypress events in JavaScript to trigger the events in the game.
(No refreshing to start the game again!!) - DONE
• Beware of following a “How to make a game in JS tutorial”. Watching a video is not the
same as learning to code. Some of the stuff you’ll have to do we won’t have covered so
If you can’t explain it or don’t understand it, you can’t use it. - DIDNT USE
• We would like you to take a Mobile first approach to the implementation. It needs to
work on different device widths. - DONE

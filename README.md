# x-men-top-trumps

My first game!

I plan to make a top trumps game where you are given a starting hand of cards and must win cards from the computer until their hand is empty.

Each card will have 4 stats that you get to choose to use if you are in control of the game, if the stat you choose beats the computer's current card you win the card
and remain in control of the game. If the stat you choose is lower than the computer's card you loose, your current card goes to the computers hand and the computer is
now incontrol of the game, they start choosing the stats and taking cards from your hand. When you win all the cards in the game, you win overall!

Course Requirements
• PSEUDOCODE: Do it. Trust me, you will thank yourself. Feel free to check this with a
coach before starting to code if you have any questions on approach.
• You need to have it as a public repository on GitHub
o In the repo you will also need a README.md with a short intro to the project.
• You must have at least 15 Git commits for the project and repo on GitHub
• Your JS code must be formatted as functions or Classes!
• You must use click or keypress events in JavaScript to trigger the events in the game.
(No refreshing to start the game again!!)
• Beware of following a “How to make a game in JS tutorial”. Watching a video is not the
same as learning to code. Some of the stuff you’ll have to do we won’t have covered so
If you can’t explain it or don’t understand it, you can’t use it.
• We would like you to take a Mobile first approach to the implementation. It needs to
work on different device widths.
• USE THE COACHES: It’s extremely normal to need help and guidance here, approaching
your first properly open ended task with no guidelines on what functions and tools are
needed. The coaches have done this a lot, make sure you use them!!!!!
• Add a link to this project on your portfolio – this is your first chance to really show off
your web skills!
